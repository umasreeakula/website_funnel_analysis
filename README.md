# Website Funnel Analysis

This dataset, available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aerodinamicc/ecommerce-website-funnel-analysis), contains user behaviour data from an e-commerce website with four pages: home, search, payment, and payment confirmation, tracking user interactions and conversion funnel progression.

There are five tables: a table for each page with the user ID and a flag indicating the user visited the page. The fifth table contains additional user information, including the device type used for accessing the website, the date of activity, and gender.

I analysed the dataset using DBeaver, connected to a PostgreSQL database system.
